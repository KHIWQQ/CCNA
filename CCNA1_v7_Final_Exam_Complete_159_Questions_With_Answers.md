---

### 14. Match the characteristic to the forwarding method. (Not all options are used.)

❌ Explanation: A store-and-forward switch always stores the entire frame before forwarding, and checks its CRC and frame length. A cut-through switch can forward frames before receiving the destination address field, thus presenting less latency than a store-and-forward switch. Because the frame can begin to be forwarded before it is completely received, the switch may transmit a corrupt or runt frame. All forwarding methods require a Layer 2 switch to forward broadcast frames.

---

### 15. Refer to the exhibit. The IP address of which device interface should be used as the default gateway setting of host H1?

❌ R1: S0/0/0

❌ R2: S0/0/1

✅ R1: G0/0

❌ R2: S0/0/0

❌ Explanation: The default gateway for host H1 is the router interface that is attached to the LAN that H1 is a member of. In this case, that is the G0/0 interface of R1. H1 should be configured with the IP address of that interface in its addressing settings. R1 will provide routing services to packets from H1 that need to be forwarded to remote networks.

---

### 34. What does the term “attenuation” mean in data communication?

❌ strengthening of a signal by a networking device

❌ leakage of signals from one cable pair to another

❌ time for a signal to reach its destination

✅ loss of signal strength as distance increases

❌ Explanation: Data is transmitted on copper cables as electrical pulses. A detector in the network interface of a destination device must receive a signal that can be successfully decoded to match the signal sent. However, the farther the signal travels, the more it deteriorates. This is referred to as signal attenuation.

---

### 35. Refer to the exhibit. An administrator is trying to configure the switch but receives the error message that is displayed in the exhibit. What is the problem?

❌ The entire command, configure terminal, must be used.

❌ The administrator is already in global configuration mode.

✅ The administrator must first enter privileged EXEC mode before issuing the command.

### 39. What are two characteristics of IP? (Choose two.)

✅ does not require a dedicated end-to-end connection

✅ operates independently of the network media

❌ retransmits packets if errors occur

❌ re-assembles out of order packets into the correct order at the receiver end

❌ guarantees delivery of packets

**อธิบาย**: The Internet Protocol (IP) is a connectionless, best effort protocol. This means that IP requires no end-to-end connection nor does it guarantee delivery of packets. IP is also media independent, which means it operates independently of the network media carrying the packets.

---

### 40. An employee of a large corporation remotely logs into the company using the appropriate username and password. The employee is attending an important video conference with a customer concerning a large sale. It is important for the video quality to be excellent during the meeting. The employee is unaware that after a successful login, the connection to the company ISP failed. The secondary connection, however, activated within seconds. The disruption was not noticed by the employee or other employees.
What three network characteristics are described in this scenario? (Choose three.)

✅ security

✅ quality of service

❌ scalability

❌ powerline networking

### 42. Which subnet would include the address 192.168.1.96 as a usable host address?

✅ 192.168.1.64/26

❌ 192.168.1.32/27

❌ 192.168.1.32/28

❌ 192.168.1.64/29

❌ Explanation: For the subnet of 192.168.1.64/26, there are 6 bits for host addresses, yielding 64 possible addresses. However, the first and last subnets are the network and broadcast addresses for this subnet. Therefore, the range of host addresses for this subnet is 192.168.1.65 to 192.168.1.126. The other subnets do not contain the address 192.168.1.96 as a valid host address.

---

### 43. Refer to the exhibit. On the basis of the output, which two statements about network connectivity are correct? (Choose two.)

❌ This host does not have a default gateway configured.

✅ There is connectivity between this device and the device at 192.168.100.1.

❌ The connectivity between these two hosts allows for videoconferencing calls.

❌ The average transmission time between the two hosts is 2 milliseconds.

**อธิบาย**: The output displays a successful Layer 3 connection between a host computer and a host at 19.168.100.1. It can be determined that 4 hops exist between them and the average transmission time is 1 milliseconds. Layer 3 connectivity does not necessarily mean that an application can run between the hosts.

---

### 44. Which two statements describe how to assess traffic flow patterns and network traffic types using a protocol analyzer? (Choose two.)

❌ Capture traffic on the weekends when most employees are off work.

✅ Capture traffic during peak utilization times to get a good representation of the different traffic types.

❌ Only capture traffic in the areas of the network that receive most of the traffic such as the data center.

✅ Perform the capture on different network segments.

❌ Only capture WAN traffic because traffic to the web is responsible for the largest amount of traffic on a network.

❌ Explanation: Traffic flow patterns should be gathered during peak utilization times to get a good representation of the different traffic types. The capture should also be performed on different network segments because some traffic will be local to a particular segment.

---

### 45. What is the consequence of configuring a router with the ipv6 unicast-routing global configuration command?​

❌ All router interfaces will be automatically activated.

✅ The IPv6 enabled router interfaces begin sending ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages.

❌ Each router interface will generate an IPv6 link-local address.​

❌ It statically creates a global unicast address on this router.​

---

### 46. Which three layers of the OSI model map to the application layer of the TCP/IP model? (Choose three.)

✅ application

❌ network

❌ data link

✅ session

✅ presentation

❌ transport

❌ Explanation: The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: application, transport, internet, and network access. The OSI model consists of seven layers: application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical. The top three layers of the OSI model: application, presentation, and session map to the application layer of the TCP/IP model.

---

### 47. Refer to the exhibit. If PC1 is sending a packet to PC2 and routing has been configured between the two routers, what will R1 do with the Ethernet frame header attached by PC1?

❌ nothing, because the router has a route to the destination network

❌ open the header and use it to determine whether the data is to be sent out S0/0/0

❌ open the header and replace the destination MAC address with a new one

✅ remove the Ethernet header and configure a new Layer 2 header before sending it out S0/0/0

❌ Explanation: When PC1 forms the various headers attached to the data one of those headers is the Layer 2 header. Because PC1 connects to an Ethernet network, an Ethernet header is used. The source MAC address will be the MAC address of PC1 and the destination MAC address will be that of G0/0 on R1. When R1 gets that information, the router removes the Layer 2 header and creates a new one for the type of network the data will be placed onto (the serial link).

---

### 48. What will happen if the default gateway address is incorrectly configured on a host?

❌ The host cannot communicate with other hosts in the local network.

✅ The host cannot communicate with hosts in other networks.

❌ A ping from the host to 127.0.0.1 would not be successful.

❌ The host will have to use ARP to determine the correct address of the default gateway.

❌ The switch will not forward packets initiated by the host.

---

### 49. What are two features of ARP? (Choose two.)

❌ When a host is encapsulating a packet into a frame, it refers to the MAC address table to determine the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses.

❌ An ARP request is sent to all devices on the Ethernet LAN and contains the IP address of the destination host and its multicast MAC address.

✅ If a host is ready to send a packet to a local destination device and it has the IP address but not the MAC address of the destination, it generates an ARP broadcast.

❌ If no device responds to the ARP request, then the originating node will broadcast the data packet to all devices on the network segment.

✅ If a device receiving an ARP request has the destination IPv4 address, it responds with an ARP reply.

---

### 50. A network administrator is adding a new LAN to a branch office. The new LAN must support 90 connected devices. What is the smallest network mask that the network administrator can use for the new network?

✅ 255.255.255.128

---

### 52. A client packet is received by a server. The packet has a destination port number of 80. What service is the client requesting?

❌ DHCP

❌ SMTP

❌ DNS

✅ HTTP

---

### 53. What is an advantage for small organizations of adopting IMAP instead of POP?

❌ POP only allows the client to store messages in a centralized way, while IMAP allows distributed storage.

✅ Messages are kept in the mail servers until they are manually deleted from the email client.

❌ When the user connects to a POP server, copies of the messages are kept in the mail server for a short time, but IMAP keeps them for a long time.

❌ IMAP sends and retrieves email, but POP only retrieves email.

❌ Explanation: IMAP and POP are protocols that are used to retrieve email messages. The advantage of using IMAP instead of POP is that when the user connects to an IMAP-capable server, copies of the messages are downloaded to the client application. IMAP then stores the email messages on the server until the user manually deletes those messages.

---

### 54. A technician can ping the IP address of the web server of a remote company but cannot successfully ping the URL address of the same web server. Which software utility can the technician use to diagnose the problem?

❌ tracert

❌ ipconfig

❌ netstat

✅ nslookup

**อธิบาย**: Traceroute (tracert) is a utility that generates a list of hops that were successfully reached along the path from source to destination.This list can provide important verification and troubleshooting information. The ipconfig utility is used to display the IP configuration settings on a Windows PC. The Netstat utility is used to identify which active TCP connections are open and running on a networked host. Nslookup is a utility that allows the user to manually query the name servers to resolve a given host name. This utility can also be used to troubleshoot name resolution issues and to verify the current status of the name servers.

❌ applies source and destination MAC addresses to Ethernet frame

❌ integrates Layer 2 flows between 10 Gigabit Ethernet over fiber and 1 Gigabit Ethernet over copper

✅ handles communication between upper layer networking software and Ethernet NIC hardware

❌ responsible for internal structure of Ethernet frame

❌ Explanation: The data link layer is actually divided into two sublayers:

❌ + Logical Link Control (LLC): This upper sublayer defines the software processes that provide services to the network layer protocols. It places information in the frame that identifies which network layer protocol is being used for the frame. This information allows multiple Layer 3 protocols, such as IPv4 and IPv6, to utilize the same network interface and media.
+ Media Access Control (MAC): This lower sublayer defines the media access processes performed by the hardware. It provides data link layer addressing and delimiting of data according to the physical signaling requirements of the medium and the type of data link layer protocol in use.

---

### 62. What are two problems that can be caused by a large number of ARP request and reply messages? (Choose two.)

❌ Switches become overloaded because they concentrate all the traffic from the attached subnets.

✅ The ARP request is sent as a broadcast, and will flood the entire subnet.

❌ The network may become overloaded because ARP reply messages have a very large payload due to the 48-bit MAC address and 32-bit IP address that they contain.

❌ A large number of ARP request and reply messages may slow down the switching process, leading the switch to make many changes in its MAC table.

✅ All ARP request messages must be processed by all nodes on the local network.

❌ Explanation: ARP requests are sent as broadcasts:
(1) All nodes will receive them, and they will be processed by software, interrupting the CPU.
(2) The switch forwards (floods) Layer 2 broadcasts to all ports.

❌ A switch does not change its MAC table based on ARP request or reply messages. The switch populates the MAC table using the source MAC address of all frames. The ARP payload is very small and does not overload the switch.

### 64. During the process of forwarding traffic, what will the router do immediately after matching the destination IP address to a network on a directly connected routing table entry?

❌ analyze the destination IP address

✅ switch the packet to the directly connected interface

❌ look up the next-hop address for the packet

❌ discard the traffic after consulting the route table

❌ Explanation: A router receives a packet on an interface and looks at the destination IP address. It consults its routing table and matches the destination IP address to a routing table entry. The router then discovers that it has to send the packet to the next-hop address or out to a directly connected interface. When the destination address is on a directly connected interface, the packet is switched over to that interface.

✅ subnet ID

❌ subnet mask

❌ broadcast address

✅ global routing prefix

✅ interface ID

❌ Explanation: The general format for IPv6 global unicast addresses includes a global routing prefix, a subnet ID, and an interface ID. The global routing prefix is the network portion of the address. A typical global routing prefix is /48 assigned by the Internet provider. The subnet ID portion can be used by an organization to create multiple subnetwork numbers. The interface ID is similar to the host portion of an IPv4 address.

---

### 80. A network administrator is designing the layout of a new wireless network. Which three areas of concern should be accounted for when building a wireless network? (Choose three.)

❌ extensive cabling

❌ mobility options

❌ packet collision

✅ interference

✅ security

✅ coverage area

❌ Explanation: The three areas of concern for wireless networks focus on the size of the coverage area, any nearby interference, and providing network security. Extensive cabling is not a concern for wireless networks, as a wireless network will require minimal cabling for providing wireless access to hosts. Mobility options are not a component of the areas of concern for wireless networks.

---

### 81. A new network administrator has been asked to enter a banner message on a Cisco device. What is the fastest way a network administrator could test whether the banner is properly configured?

---

### 84. What is the purpose of the TCP sliding window?

❌ to ensure that segments arrive in order at the destination

❌ to end communication when data transmission is complete

❌ to inform a source to retransmit data from a specific point forward

✅ to request that a source decrease the rate at which it transmits data

❌ Explanation: The TCP sliding window allows a destination device to inform a source to slow down the rate of transmission. To do this, the destination device reduces the value contained in the window field of the segment. It is acknowledgment numbers that are used to specify retransmission from a specific point forward. It is sequence numbers that are used to ensure segments arrive in order. Finally, it is a FIN control bit that is used to end a communication session.

### 87. Which range of link-local addresses can be assigned to an IPv6-enabled interface?

❌ FEC0::/10

❌ FDEE::/7

✅ FE80::/10

❌ FF00::/8

**อธิบาย**: Link-local addresses are in the range of FE80::/10 to FEBF::/10. The original IPv6 specification defined site-local addresses and used the prefix range FEC0::/10, but these addresses were deprecated by the IETF in favor of unique local addresses. FDEE::/7 is a unique local address because it is in the range of FC00::/7 to FDFF::/7. IPv6 multicast addresses have the prefix FF00::/8.

---

### 90. Which two statements accurately describe an advantage or a disadvantage when deploying NAT for IPv4 in a network? (Choose two.)

❌ NAT adds authentication capability to IPv4.

✅ NAT introduces problems for some applications that require end-to-end connectivity.

❌ NAT will impact negatively on switch performance.

✅ NAT provides a solution to slow down the IPv4 address depletion.

❌ NAT improves packet handling.

❌ NAT causes routing tables to include more information.

❌ Explanation: Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technology that is implemented within IPv4 networks. One application of NAT is to use private IP addresses inside a network and use NAT to share a few public IP addresses for many internal hosts. In this way it provides a solution to slow down the IPv4 address depletion. However, since NAT hides the actual IP addresses that are used by end devices, it may cause problems for some applications that require end-to-end connectivity.

---

### 91. What would be the interface ID of an IPv6 enabled interface with a MAC address of 1C-6F-65-C2-BD-F8 when the interface ID is generated by using the EUI-64 process?

❌ 0C6F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8

✅ 1E6F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8

❌ C16F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8

❌ 106F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8

❌ Explanation: To derive the EUI-64 interface ID by using the MAC address 1C-6F-65-C2-BD-F8, three steps are taken.

❌ Change the seventh bit of the MAC address from a binary 0 to a binary 1 which changes the hex C, into a hex E.

❌ Insert hex digits FFFE into the middle of the address.

❌ Rewrite the address in IPv6 format.

❌ The three steps, when complete, give the interface ID of 1E6F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8.

[+] no dedicated server is required
[+] client and server roles are set on a per request basis
peer-to-peer aplication
[#] requires a specific user interface
[#] a background service is required

**อธิบาย**: Peer-to-peer networks do not require the use of a dedicated server, and devices can assume both client and server roles simultaneously on a per request basis. Because they do not require formalized accounts or permissions, they are best used in limited situations. Peer-to-peer applications require a user interface and background service to be running, and can be used in more diverse situations.

---

### 97. What are two primary responsibilities of the Ethernet MAC sublayer? (Choose two.)

❌ error detection

❌ frame delimiting

❌ It requires that a user type encrypted passwords to gain console access to a router or switch.

❌ It encrypts passwords as they are sent across the network.

**อธิบาย**: The service password-encryption command encrypts plaintext passwords in the configuration file so that they cannot be viewed by unauthorized users.

---

### 104. Which two statements are correct in a comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers? (Choose two.)

✅ The Source Address field name from IPv4 is kept in IPv6.

❌ The Version field from IPv4 is not kept in IPv6.

❌ The Destination Address field is new in IPv6.

❌ The Header Checksum field name from IPv4 is kept in IPv6.

✅ The Time-to-Live field from IPv4 has been replaced by the Hop Limit field in IPv6.

❌ Explanation: The IPv6 packet header fields are as follows: Version, Traffic Class, Flow Label, Payload Length, Next Header, Hop Limit, Source Address, and Destination Address. The IPv4 packet header fields include the following: Version, Differentiated Services, Time-to-Live, Protocol, Source IP Address, and Destination IP Address. Both versions have a 4-bit Version field. Both versions have a Source (IP) Address field. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits; IPv6 addresses are 128 bits. The Time-to-Live or TTL field in IPv4 is now called Hop Limit in IPv6, but this field serves the same purpose in both versions. The value in this 8-bit field decrements each time a packet passes through any router. When this value is 0, the packet is discarded and is not forwarded to any other router.

---

### 105. A network administrator wants to have the same network mask for all networks at a particular small site. The site has the following networks and number of devices:
IP phones – 22 addresses

❌ The woven copper braid should not have been removed.

❌ The wrong type of connector is being used.

✅ The untwisted length of each wire is too long.

❌ The wires are too thick for the connector that is used.

❌ Explanation: When a cable to an RJ-45 connector is terminated, it is important to ensure that the untwisted wires are not too long and that the flexible plastic sheath surrounding the wires is crimped down and not the bare wires. None of the colored wires should be visible from the bottom of the jack.

---

### 110. Match the characteristic to the category. (Not all options are used.)

---

### 111. A client packet is received by a server. The packet has a destination port number of 143. What service is the client requesting?

✅ IMAP

❌ FTP

❌ SSH

❌ Telnet

---

### 112. What are two characteristics shared by TCP and UDP? (Choose two.)

❌ default window size

❌ connectionless communication

✅ port numbering

❌ 3-way handshake

❌ ability to to carry digitized voice

✅ use of checksum

**อธิบาย**: Both TCP and UDP use source and destination port numbers to distinguish different data streams and to forward the right data segments to the right applications. Error checking the header and data is done by both protocols by using a checksum calculation to determine the integrity of the data that is received. TCP is connection-oriented and uses a 3-way handshake to establish an initial connection. TCP also uses window to regulate the amount of traffic sent before receiving an acknowledgment. UDP is connectionless and is the best protocol for carry digitized VoIP signals.

---

### 113. Refer to the exhibit. Which two network addresses can be assigned to the network containing 10 hosts? Your answers should waste the fewest addresses, not reuse addresses that are already assigned, and stay within the 10.18.10.0/24 range of addresses. (Choose two.)

❌ 10.18.10.200/28

✅ 10.18.10.208/28

❌ 10.18.10.240/27

❌ 10.18.10.200/27

❌ 10.18.10.224/27

✅ 10.18.10.224/28

❌ Explanation: Addresses 10.18.10.0 through 10.18.10.63 are taken for the leftmost network. Addresses 192 through 199 are used by the center network. Because 4 host bits are needed to accommodate 10 hosts, a /28 mask is needed. 10.18.10.200/28 is not a valid network number. Two subnets that can be used are 10.18.10.208/28 and 10.18.10.224/28.

❌ wrapping a foil shield around the wire pairs

✅ twisting the wires together into pairs

❌ terminating the cable with special grounded connectors

❌ encasing the cables within a flexible plastic sheath

❌ Explanation: To help prevent the effects of crosstalk, UTP cable wires are twisted together into pairs. Twisting the wires together causes the magnetic fields of each wire to cancel each other out.

---

### 118. Refer to the exhibit. The network administrator has assigned the LAN of LBMISS an address range of 192.168.10.0. This address range has been subnetted using a /29 prefix. In order to accommodate a new building, the technician has decided to use the fifth subnet for configuring the new network (subnet zero is the first subnet). By company policies, the router interface is always assigned the first usable host address and the workgroup server is given the last usable host address. Which configuration should be entered into the properties of the workgroup server to allow connectivity to the Internet?

❌ IP address: 192.168.10.65 subnet mask: 255.255.255.240, default gateway: 192.168.10.76

❌ IP address: 192.168.10.38 subnet mask: 255.255.255.240, default gateway: 192.168.10.33

✅ IP address: 192.168.10.38 subnet mask: 255.255.255.248, default gateway: 192.168.10.33

❌ IP address: 192.168.10.41 subnet mask: 255.255.255.248, default gateway: 192.168.10.46

❌ IP address: 192.168.10.254 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0, default gateway: 192.168.10.1

**อธิบาย**: Using a /29 prefix to subnet 192.168.10.0 results in subnets that increment by 8:

### 119. Refer to the exhibit. The switches are in their default configuration. Host A needs to communicate with host D, but host A does not have the MAC address for its default gateway. Which network hosts will receive the ARP request sent by host A?

❌ only host D

❌ only router R1

❌ only hosts A, B, and C

❌ only hosts A, B, C, and D

❌ only hosts B and C

✅ only hosts B, C, and router R1

**อธิบาย**: Since host A does not have the MAC address of the default gateway in its ARP table, host A sends an ARP broadcast. The ARP broadcast would be sent to every device on the local network. Hosts B, C, and router R1 would receive the broadcast. Router R1 would not forward the message.

### 120. Match a statement to the related network model. (Not all options are used.)

❌ ITN (Version 7.00) – ITNv7 Final Exam

✅ Place the options in the following order:peer-to-peer network
[+] no dedicated server is required
[+] client and server roles are set on a per request basis
peer-to-peer aplication
[#] requires a specific user interface
[#] a background service is required

**อธิบาย**: Peer-to-peer networks do not require the use of a dedicated server, and devices can assume both client and server roles simultaneously on a per request basis. Because they do not require formalized accounts or permissions, they are best used in limited situations. Peer-to-peer applications require a user interface and background service to be running, and can be used in more diverse situations.

---

---

### 126. Match the header field with the appropriate layer of the OSI model. (Not all options are used.)

---

### 127. Refer to the exhibit. The switches have a default configuration. Host A needs to communicate with host D, but host A does not have the MAC address for the default gateway. Which network devices will receive the ARP request sent by host A?

❌ i360201v3n1_275353.png

❌ only host D

❌ only hosts A, B, C, and D

❌ only hosts B and C

✅ only hosts B, C, and router R1

❌ only hosts A, B, and C

❌ only router R1

❌ Explanation: Because host A does not have the MAC address of the default gateway in the ARP table, host A sends an ARP broadcast. The ARP broadcast would be sent to every device on the local network. Hosts B, C, and router R1 would receive the broadcast. Router R1 would not forward the message.

---

### 128. Which wireless technology has low-power and low-data rate requirements making it popular in IoT environments?

❌ Bluetooth

✅ Zigbee

❌ WiMAX

❌ Wi-Fi

❌ Explanation: Zigbee is a specification used for low-data rate, low-power communications. It is intended for applications that require short-range, low data-rates and long battery life. Zigbee is typically used for industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) environments such as wireless light switches and medical device data collection.

---

### 129. What two ICMPv6 message types must be permitted through IPv6 access control lists to allow resolution of Layer 3 addresses to Layer 2 MAC addresses? (Choose two.)

✅ neighbor solicitations

❌ echo requests

✅ neighbor advertisements

❌ echo replies

❌ router solicitations

❌ router advertisements

---

### 130. A client is using SLAAC to obtain an IPv6 address for its interface. After an address has been generated and applied to the interface, what must the client do before it can begin to use this IPv6 address?

❌ It must send a DHCPv6 INFORMATION-REQUEST message to request the address of the DNS server.

❌ It must send a DHCPv6 REQUEST message to the DHCPv6 server to request permission to use this address.

❌ It must send an ICMPv6 Router Solicitation message to determine what default gateway it should use.

✅ It must send an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation message to ensure that the address is not already in use on the network.

---

### 131. Two pings were issued from a host on a local network. The first ping was issued to the IP address of the default gateway of the host and it failed. The second ping was issued to the IP address of a host outside the local network and it was successful. What is a possible cause for the failed ping?

❌ The default gateway is not operational.

❌ The default gateway device is configured with the wrong IP address.

✅ Security rules are applied to the default gateway device, preventing it from processing ping requests.

❌ The TCP/IP stack on the default gateway is not working properly.

---

### 132. An organization is assigned an IPv6 address block of 2001:db8:0:ca00::/56. How many subnets can be created without using bits in the interface ID space?

✅ 256

❌ 512

❌ 1024

❌ 4096

---

### 133. What subnet mask is needed if an IPv4 network has 40 devices that need IP addresses and address space is not to be wasted?

❌ 255.255.255.0

❌ 255.255.255.240

❌ 255.255.255.128

✅ 255.255.255.192

❌ 255.255.255.224

❌ Explanation: In order to accommodate 40 devices, 6 host bits are needed. With 6 bits, 64 addresses are possible, but one address is for the subnet number and one address is for a broadcast. This leaves 62 addresses that can be assigned to network devices. The mask associated with leaving 6 host bits for addressing is 255.255.255.192.

---

### 134. Refer to the exhibit. If host A sends an IP packet to host B, what will the destination address be in the frame when it leaves host A?

❌ DD:DD:DD:DD:DD:DD

❌ 172.168.10.99

❌ CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC

❌ 172.168.10.65

✅ BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB

❌ AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA

**อธิบาย**: When a host sends information to a distant network, the Layer 2 frame header will contain a source and destination MAC address. The source address will be the originating host device. The destination address will be the router interface that connects to the same network. In the case of host A sending information to host B, the source address is AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA and the destination address is the MAC address assigned to the R2 Ethernet interface, BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB.

---

### 135. What is a benefit of using cloud computing in networking?

❌ Technology is integrated into every-day appliances allowing them to interconnect with other devices, making them more ‘smart’ or automated.

✅ Network capabilities are extended without requiring investment in new infrastructure, personnel, or software.

❌ End users have the freedom to use personal tools to access information and communicate across a business network.

❌ Home networking uses existing electrical wiring to connect devices to the network wherever there is an electrical outlet, saving the cost of installing data cables.

❌ Explanation: Cloud computing extends IT’s capabilities without requiring investment in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. These services are available on-demand and delivered economically to any device anywhere in the world without compromising security or function. BYOD is about end users having the freedom to use personal tools to access information and communicate across a business or campus network. Smart home technology is integrated into every-day appliances allowing them to interconnect with other devices, making them more ‘smart’ or automated. Powerline networking is a trend for home networking that uses existing electrical wiring to connect devices to the network wherever there is an electrical outlet, saving the cost of installing data cables.

---

### 136. Which two statements are correct about MAC and IP addresses during data transmission if NAT is not involved? (Choose two.)

✅ Destination IP addresses in a packet header remain constant along the entire path to a target host.

❌ Destination MAC addresses will never change in a frame that goes across seven routers.

❌ Every time a frame is encapsulated with a new destination MAC address, a new destination IP address is needed.

✅ Destination and source MAC addresses have local significance and change every time a frame goes from one LAN to another.

❌ A packet that has crossed four routers has changed the destination IP address four times.

---

### 137. What is one main characteristic of the data link layer?

❌ It generates the electrical or optical signals that represent the 1 and 0 on the media.

❌ It converts a stream of data bits into a predefined code.

✅ It shields the upper layer protocol from being aware of the physical medium to be used in the communication.

❌ It accepts Layer 3 packets and decides the path by which to forward the packet to a remote network.

---

### 138. What are three characteristics of the CSMA/CD process? (Choose three.)

❌ The device with the electronic token is the only one that can transmit after a collision.

✅ A device listens and waits until the media is not busy before transmitting.

✅ After detecting a collision, hosts can attempt to resume transmission after a random time delay has expired.

✅ All of the devices on a segment see data that passes on the network medium.

❌ A jam signal indicates that the collision has cleared and the media is not busy.

❌ Devices can be configured with a higher transmission priority.

❌ Explanation: The Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) process is a contention-based media access control mechanism used on shared media access networks, such as Ethernet. When a device needs to transmit data, it listens and waits until the media is available (quiet), then it will send data. If two devices transmit at the same time, a collision will occur. Both devices will detect the collision on the network. When a device detects a collision, it will stop the data transmission process, wait for a random amount of time, then try again.

---

### 139. Which information does the show startup-config command display?

❌ the IOS image copied into RAM

❌ the bootstrap program in the ROM

❌ the contents of the current running configuration file in the RAM

✅ the contents of the saved configuration file in the NVRAM

**อธิบาย**: The show startup-config command displays the saved configuration located in NVRAM. The show running-config command displays the contents of the currently running configuration file located in RAM.​

---

### 140. Which two commands can be used on a Windows host to display the routing table? (Choose two.)

❌ netstat -s

✅ route print

❌ show ip route

✅ netstat -r

❌ tracert

**อธิบาย**: On a Windows host, the route print or netstat -r commands can be used to display the host routing table. Both commands generate the same output. On a router, the show ip route command is used to display the routing table. The netstat –s command is used to display per-protocol statistics. The tracert command is used to display the path that a packet travels to its destination.

---

### 141. What are two functions that are provided by the network layer? (Choose two.)

✅ directing data packets to destination hosts on other networks

❌ placing data on the network medium

❌ carrying data between processes that are running on source and destination hosts

❌ providing dedicated end-to-end connections

✅ providing end devices with a unique network identifier

❌ Explanation: The network layer is primarily concerned with passing data from a source to a destination on another network. IP addresses supply unique identifiers for the source and destination. The network layer provides connectionless, best-effort delivery. Devices rely on higher layers to supply services to processes.

---

### 142. Which two statements describe features of an IPv4 routing table on a router? (Choose two.)​

❌ Directly connected interfaces will have two route source codes in the routing table: C and S .

❌ If there are two or more possible routes to the same destination, the route associated with the higher metric value is included in the routing table.

❌ The netstat -r command can be used to display the routing table of a router.​

❌ The routing table lists the MAC addresses of each active interface.

✅ It stores information about routes derived from the active router interfaces.

✅ If a default static route is configured in the router, an entry will be included in the routing table with source code S .

❌ Other case:

❌ The netstat -r command can be used to display the routing table of a router.​

✅ The routing table stores information about routes derived from the active router interfaces.

❌ The routing table lists the MAC addresses of each active interface.

❌ Directly connected interfaces will have two route source codes in the routing table: C and S .

✅ If a default static route is configured in the router, an entry will be included in the routing table with source code S

❌ Explanation: The show ip route command is used to display the routing table of the router. In IPv4, directly connected interfaces will have one source code:C. The routing table stores information about directly connected routes and remote routes. An entry in the routing table with a source code of S is included if a default static route is configured on the router.

---

### 143. What characteristic describes a VPN?

❌ software on a router that filters traffic based on IP addresses or applications

❌ software that identifies fast-spreading threats

✅ a tunneling protocol that provides remote users with secure access into the network of an organization

❌ a network device that filters access and traffic coming into a network

---

### 144. Why would a Layer 2 switch need an IP address?

❌ to enable the switch to send broadcast frames to attached PCs

❌ to enable the switch to function as a default gateway

✅ to enable the switch to be managed remotely

❌ to enable the switch to receive frames from attached PCs

❌ Explanation: A switch, as a Layer 2 device, does not need an IP address to transmit frames to attached devices. However, when a switch is accessed remotely through the network, it must have a Layer 3 address. The IP address must be applied to a virtual interface rather than to a physical interface. Routers, not switches, function as default gateways.

---

### 145. Match each description to its corresponding term. (Not all options are used.)

---

### 146. A user sends an HTTP request to a web server on a remote network. During encapsulation for this request, what information is added to the address field of a frame to indicate the destination?

❌ the network domain of the destination host

❌ the IP address of the default gateway

❌ the MAC address of the destination host

✅ the MAC address of the default gateway

❌ Explanation: A frame is encapsulated with source and destination MAC addresses. The source device will not know the MAC address of the remote host. An ARP request will be sent by the source and will be responded to by the router. The router will respond with the MAC address of its interface, the one which is connected to the same network as the source.

---

### 147. What is an advantage to using a protocol that is defined by an open standard?

❌ A company can monopolize the market.

❌ The protocol can only be run on equipment from a specific vendor.

❌ An open standard protocol is not controlled or regulated by standards organizations.

✅ It encourages competition and promotes choices.

**อธิบาย**: A monopoly by one company is not a good idea from a user point of view. If a protocol can only be run on one brand, it makes it difficult to have mixed equipment in a network. A proprietary protocol is not free to use. An open standard protocol will in general be implemented by a wide range of vendors.

---

### 148. Data is being sent from a source PC to a destination server. Which three statements correctly describe the function of TCP or UDP in this situation? (Choose three.)

✅ The source port field identifies the running application or service that will handle data returning to the PC.

❌ The TCP process running on the PC randomly selects the destination port when establishing a session with the server.

✅ UDP segments are encapsulated within IP packets for transport across the network.

✅ The UDP destination port number identifies the application or service on the server which will handle the data.

❌ TCP is the preferred protocol when a function requires lower network overhead.

❌ The TCP source port number identifies the sending host on the network.

❌ Explanation: Layer 4 port numbers identify the application or service which will handle the data. The source port number is added by the sending device and will be the destination port number when the requested information is returned. Layer 4 segments are encapsulated within IP packets. UDP, not TCP, is used when low overhead is needed. A source IP address, not a TCP source port number, identifies the sending host on the network. Destination port numbers are specific ports that a server application or service monitors for requests.

---

### 149. Match each description with the corresponding TCP mechanism. (Not all options are used.)

---

### 150. Refer to the exhibit. A company uses the address block of 128.107.0.0/16 for its network. What subnet mask would provide the maximum number of equal size subnets while providing enough host addresses for each subnet in the exhibit?

❌ 255.255.255.192

❌ 255.255.255.0

✅ 255.255.255.128

❌ 255.255.255.240

❌ 255.255.255.224

❌ Explanation: The largest subnet in the topology has 100 hosts in it so the subnet mask must have at least 7 host bits in it (27-2=126). 255.255.255.0 has 8 hosts bits, but this does not meet the requirement of providing the maximum number of subnets.

---

### 151. A network administrator wants to have the same subnet mask for three subnetworks at a small site. The site has the following networks and numbers of devices:

❌ Subnetwork A: IP phones – 10 addresses

❌ Subnetwork B: PCs – 8 addresses

❌ Subnetwork C: Printers – 2 addresses

❌ What single subnet mask would be appropriate to use for the three subnetworks?

❌ 255.255.255.0

✅ 255.255.255.240

❌ 255.255.255.248

❌ 255.255.255.252

**อธิบาย**: If the same mask is to be used, then the network with the most hosts must be examined for number of hosts. Because this is 10 hosts, 4 host bits are needed. The /28 or 255.255.255.240 subnet mask would be appropriate to use for these networks. ​

---

### 152. Match each item to the type of topology diagram on which it is typically identified. (Not all options are used.)

❌ A logical topology diagram typically depicts the IP addressing scheme and groupings of devices and ports. A physical topology diagram shows how those devices are connected to each other and the network, focusing on the physical locations of intermediary devices, configured ports, and cabling.

---

### 153. What two pieces of information are displayed in the output of the show ip interface brief command? (Choose two.)

✅ IP addresses

❌ interface descriptions

❌ MAC addresses

❌ next-hop addresses

✅ Layer 1 statuses

❌ speed and duplex settings

❌ Explanation: The command show ip interface brief shows the IP address of each interface, as well as the operational status of the interfaces at both Layer 1 and Layer 2. In order to see interface descriptions and speed and duplex settings, use the command show running-config interface. Next-hop addresses are displayed in the routing table with the command show ip route, and the MAC address of an interface can be seen with the command show interfaces.

---

### 154. A user is complaining that an external web page is taking longer than normal to load.The web page does eventually load on the user machine. Which tool should the technician use with administrator privileges in order to locate where the issue is in the network?

❌ ping

❌ nslookup

✅ tracert

❌ ipconfig /displaydns

❌ Explanation: The Command Prompt command tracert will map the path from the PC to the web server and measure transit delays of packets across the network.

---

### 155. Which value, that is contained in an IPv4 header field, is decremented by each router that receives a packet?

❌ Header Length

❌ Differentiated Services

✅ Time-to-Live

❌ Fragment Offset

❌ Explanation: When a router receives a packet, the router will decrement the Time-to-Live (TTL) field by one. When the field reaches zero, the receiving router will discard the packet and will send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the sender.

---

### 156. A network technician is researching the use of fiber optic cabling in a new technology center. Which two issues should be considered before implementing fiber optic media? (Choose two.)

✅ Fiber optic cabling requires different termination and splicing expertise from what copper cabling requires.

❌ Fiber optic cabling requires specific grounding to be immune to EMI.

❌ Fiber optic cabling is susceptible to loss of signal due to RFI.

❌ Fiber optic cable is able to withstand rough handling.

✅ Fiber optic provides higher data capacity but is more expensive than copper cabling.

❌ Explanation: Fiber optic media is more expensive than copper cabling used over the same distance. Fiber optic cables use light instead of an electrical signal, so EMI and RFI are not issues. However, fiber optic does require different skills to terminate and splice.

---

### 157. Match each description with an appropriate IP address. (Not all options are used.)

---

### 158. A user is executing a tracert to a remote device. At what point would a router, which is in the path to the destination device, stop forwarding the packet?

❌ when the router receives an ICMP Time Exceeded message

❌ when the RTT value reaches zero

❌ when the host responds with an ICMP Echo Reply message

✅ when the value in the TTL field reaches zero

❌ when the values of both the Echo Request and Echo Reply messages reach zero

**อธิบาย**: When a router receives a traceroute packet, the value in the TTL field is decremented by 1. When the value in the field reaches zero, the receiving router will not forward the packet, and will send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source.

---

### 159. Users report that the network access is slow. After questioning the employees, the network administrator learned that one employee downloaded a third-party scanning program for the printer. What type of malware might be introduced that causes slow performance of the network?

❌ virus

✅ worm

❌ phishing

❌ spam

❌ Explanation: A cybersecurity specialist needs to be familiar with the characteristics of the different types of malware and attacks that threaten an organization.

### 🔧 Important Concepts

**1. Store-and-Forward vs Cut-Through Switching**:

| ลักษณะ | Store-and-Forward | Cut-Through |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| การทำงาน | รับ frame ทั้งหมดก่อน forward | Forward ทันทีที่ได้รับ destination MAC |
| CRC Check | ✅ ตรวจสอบ | ❌ ไม่ตรวจสอบ |
| Latency | สูงกว่า | ต่ำกว่า |
| Error | ไม่ forward frame ที่ error | อาจ forward frame ที่ error |
| เหมาะกับ | Network ที่ต้องการความถูกต้อง | Network ที่ต้องการความเร็ว |

**2. CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection)**:
- **Listen before transmit**: รอจนสื่อว่างก่อนส่ง
- **Detect collision**: ตรวจจับการชน
- **Random backoff**: รอระยะเวลาสุ่มหลังเกิด collision
- **All devices see data**: อุปกรณ์ทั้งหมดเห็นข้อมูลบน segment

**3. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
- แปลง IP address → MAC address
- ใช้สำหรับ IPv4
- ARP Request = Broadcast
- ARP Reply = Unicast

**4. IPv4 Header Fields**:
- **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: ลดลง 1 ที่แต่ละ router, ถ้า = 0 จะ drop packet
- **Protocol**: ระบุ protocol ของ layer ถัดไป (TCP=6, UDP=17, ICMP=1)
- **Source IP**: IP address ต้นทาง
- **Destination IP**: IP address ปลายทาง

**5. Cable Issues**:
- **EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)**: คลื่นแม่เหล็กไฟฟ้า
- **RFI (Radio Frequency Interference)**: คลื่นวิทยุ
- **Crosstalk**: สัญญาณรั่วไหลระหว่างสาย
- **Attenuation**: สัญญาณอ่อนลงตามระยะทาง

### 🌍 IPv6 Basics

**ประเภทของ IPv6 Address**:
- **Global Unicast**: 2000::/3 - ใช้บน Internet
- **Link-Local**: FE80::/10 - ใช้ใน local network เท่านั้น
- **Unique Local**: FC00::/7 - คล้าย private IP
- **Multicast**: FF00::/8 - ส่งถึงหลายอุปกรณ์
- **Loopback**: ::1 - คล้าย 127.0.0.1

**ICMPv6 Messages**:
- **Neighbor Solicitation (NS)**: หา MAC address (คล้าย ARP Request)
- **Neighbor Advertisement (NA)**: ตอบ NS (คล้าย ARP Reply)
- **Router Solicitation (RS)**: ขอข้อมูล router
- **Router Advertisement (RA)**: ส่งข้อมูล router

### 📊 QoS (Quality of Service)

**ลำดับความสำคัญ (จากสูงไปต่ำ)**:
1. **Voice/Audio** 🎤 - Real-time, ต้องการ latency ต่ำ
2. **Video** 🎥 - Real-time, ต้องการ bandwidth สูง
3. **Transaction Data** 💰 - Critical business data
4. **Web Traffic** 🌐 - Best effort

### 🎓 Tips สำหรับการสอบ

**1. การอ่านคำถาม**:
- ดูว่าต้องเลือกกี่คำตอบ: **(Choose two)**, **(Choose three)**
- คำสำคัญ: **NOT**, **EXCEPT**, **LEAST**, **MOST**
- Scenario questions: อ่านสถานการณ์ให้เข้าใจก่อนตอบ

**2. Subnetting**:
- จำสูตร: Usable Hosts = 2^(host bits) - 2
- เริ่มจากจำนวน hosts ที่ต้องการ → คำนวณ host bits → หา subnet mask
- ระวังคำถามที่ถาม "smallest mask" vs "largest mask"

**3. Port Numbers**:
- จำ Port ที่ถูกถามบ่อย: 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 23 (Telnet), 25 (SMTP), 53 (DNS), 80 (HTTP), 110 (POP3), 443 (HTTPS)
- เทคนิค: จัดกลุ่มตามช่วงเลข (20s, 50s-60s, 80s-100s-400s)

**4. Protocols & Models**:
- เข้าใจความแตกต่างระหว่าง TCP/IP Model (4 layers) และ OSI Model (7 layers)
- รู้ว่า protocol แต่ละตัวทำงานที่ layer ไหน
- TCP vs UDP: TCP = reliable, UDP = fast

**5. Commands**:
- Windows: `ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, `arp -a`, `nslookup`
- Cisco: `show` commands, `enable`, `configure terminal`
- เข้าใจ output ของแต่ละคำสั่ง

**6. Security**:
- เข้าใจประเภท malware: Virus, Worm, Trojan
- เข้าใจประเภทการโจมตี: DoS, Phishing
- AAA: Authentication → Authorization → Accounting

**7. การจัดการเวลา**:
- มีเวลา 1:15 ชม. สำหรับ 159 ข้อ ≈ 28 วินาทีต่อข้อ
- ทำข้อง่ายก่อน ข้อยากค้างไว้ทีหลัง
- ตรวจทานคำตอบก่อนส่ง

**8. Exhibit Questions**:
- ดูภาพ/ตารางให้ละเอียด
- หา IP address, subnet mask, gateway ให้ถูกต้อง
- ระวัง Layer 2 (MAC) vs Layer 3 (IP) addressing
